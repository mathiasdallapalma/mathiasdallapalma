## Hi there 👋

I'm a passionate Computer Science student with a strong interest in data science, web development, and 3D rendering.
I've worked on a variety of projects — from training ML models and building web apps to exploring 5G networking, static code analysis, photogrammetry, and virtual reality.

When I'm not coding, you'll probably find me in the mountains helping out with my family's horse breeding business 🐎🌿 — teamwork, problem-solving, and fresh air included.

Here you'll find a collection of my projects, experiments, and ideas. Feel free to explore, fork, or just say hi!
